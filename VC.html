<center><b>Beyonce has the Best Vocals and Choreographies.</b></center>
<center> <p>Most Popstars are judged based off of two abilities. Can they sing or dance?
Usually one is more stronger at one than the other. For example, Britney Spears is a good dancer
but her singing abilities can be seen as lackluster. With Adele she is a great vocalist but has shown
that dancing is not one of her skills. While Beyonce has conquered both areas, great singer and great dancer which 
is not common in music today.   
Beyonce's Vocal Range: A2 to E6
- 4 octives 
- longest high note is 14 seconds
Her vocal range and technique is hard to master but singing after busting out into full on choreography is exceptional.
Her choreography aren't just two-steps while clapping hands, these are dances made by well known and praised choreographers 
such as JaQuel Knight and Frank Gatson Jr.
